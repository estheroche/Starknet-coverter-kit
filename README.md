# starknet_converter

This is a repository for my experimentation with rust, starknet_converter is a cli tooling, I am building to understand rust and how to work with field element in starknet.

Basically, it contains functionalities such as converting:
-  `string_to_felt`,
- `felt_to_string`,
-  `string_to_hex`,
-  `hex_to_string`
